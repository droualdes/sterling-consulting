### Challenge

Online banking for business needed significant upgrade. This national retail bank was on the fast track to launch enhanced features to attract additional small business clients and meet the needs of current customers.

### Solution Delivered

Sterling Consultants managed the project team and developers across multiple IT divisions and technology platforms to develop project plan, created and managed issues and issue resolution, constructed functional specifications, walkthroughs, user acceptance testing, QA, change management queue, regression testing, launch and post launch upgrades.

Working with business partners, consultants helped to develop, test and launch new features including: online brokerage, access to Quicken and Money; Account Activity and Transfer Services; On Line Statements, and Email Alerts. All features were launched on time and 10% under budget; additionally, streamlining of developersâ€™ roles and responsibilities eliminated redundancies in development efforts for estimated annual savings of $1.5M.
