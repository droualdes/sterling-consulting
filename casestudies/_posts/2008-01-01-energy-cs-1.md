### Challenge

Client needed technology to track, manage, and report customer rebates received from purchasing energy efficient products. Our client was faced with the challenge of tracking rebates provided to consumers who purchase products that include a rebate. An antiquated system was in place which required either an upgrade, modification or replacement.

### Solution Delivered

Sterling provided a business requirements analyst to gather comprehensive requirements. The requirements were used to develop an RFP. A Sterling Business PM also led the effort to keep the project on track and to manage and resolve the issues and risks. The client made the decision to band aid the existing system until a more robust platform and service provider could be identified.
